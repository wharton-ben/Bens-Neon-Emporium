# Bens-Neon-Emporium
This was my final project in my web development course at the University of Central Missouri

The goal of this project was to create a static webpage to demonstrate what I had learned in the class.

The site is designed to be responsive. - Credit to Colt Steele. I used his course The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp as a guide to implementing this feature. 

This webpage will be modified frequently.
